# Hacking root password of MariaDB
With Powershell - run with admin privileges
    go to MariaDB installation folder (in the bin folder)
    see if MariaDB service is running: Get-service
    stop service: net stop MariaDB

    start MariaDB without loading user privilege information, it will allow you to access the database command line with root privileges without entering a password. This will allow you to access the database without knowing the passphrase. To do this, you need to prevent the database from loading privilege tables that contain user privilege information. Since this carries a security risk, you should also avoid network activity in order to prevent other clients from connecting.
    .\mysqld --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking --shared-memory
    The shell should NOT shut down, that is, now nothing can be entered into this command line window

With Powershell - run standard (no admin privileges)
    go to MariaDB installation folder (in the bin folder)
    .\mysql -u root
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES; - this loads the privileges table (to detect root user)
    Depending on MariaDB version, either one will work:
        ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
        SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('new_password');
    Do not forget to reload privileges
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        Expect a positive feedback, like: Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
    Exit session
        exit;

Close all shells
Restart server, or restart PC
You have changed root password
